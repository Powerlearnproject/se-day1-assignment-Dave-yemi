Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

ANS: Software Engineering is all about applying engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It involves software design, development, testing, deployment and maintaining. 

It helps in enabling the creating of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

ANS: Development of programming language 
It became a discipline [1960s]
Rise of Agile Methodologies [2000s]


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

ANS: Requirements: it involves gathering of user needs and systems requirement.
Design: its creating high level and detailed design for the system.
Implementation: it's the writing of code and building of the system.
Testing: it's the testing of the quality standard and functional requirements.
Deployment: it's the releasing of the software to the user.
Maintenance: it involves providing support and updating of the software. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

ANS: Waterfall is suitable for projects with predictable requirements, while Agile is ideal for projects with uncertain or changing requirements.

Waterfall:
Suitable for projects with clear, fixed requirements (e.g building a house)
Appropriate for industries with strict regulations (e.g finance, healthcare)
Agile:
Ideal for projects with uncertain or changing requirements (e.g software development)
Suitable for innovative, fast-paced environments (e.g startups, tech companies)

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

ANS:
Software Developer:
Designs, develops, and tests software applications.
Writes clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

Quality Assurance Engineer:
Develops and executes testing plans to ensure software quality.
Identifies and reports defects, and collaborates with developers to resolve issues.

Project Manager:
Oversees project planning, execution, and delivery.
Sets goals, priorities, and timelines for the team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

ANS: 
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) streamline software development, improving productivity and reducing errors. They offer tools for writhing/debugging/testing code. E.g Eclipse, Visual Studio code.

Version Control Systems (VCS) track changes, enable collaboration, and maintain code history. They manage versions, support collaboration, and allow reversion to previous versions. E.g. Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

ANS:
Challenge; Changing Requirements 
Tight Deadline 
Technical debt 

Strategies: Effective communication 
Agile Methodologies 
Prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

ANS: 
Unit Testing: it tests individual components or units of code to ensure they work correctly.
Integration Testing: tests how units work together to ensure seamless integration.
System Testing: tests the entire system to ensure it meets requirements and works as expected.
Acceptance Testing: tests the system with real-world scenarios to ensure it meets user needs.

Together, they help ensure a high-quality software product.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

ANS: Promt engineering it is about creating questions and statements to get the best result from the AI.
It helps in making your question clear for best result from the AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

ANS:
Vague prompt:
Build a website for a school.

Improved prompt:
Design and develop an informative website for Springdale High School, featuring student and teacher profiles, upcoming events, news, and resources for parents, with a user-friendly interface and mobile responsiveness.

The improved prompt is more effective because it:
Specifies the type of website.
Identifies the target audience.
Clearly defines the required features (profiles, events, news, resources)
Includes technical requirements (user-friendly interface, mobile responsiveness)
